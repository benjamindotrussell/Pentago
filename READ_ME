Min-max Algorithm
nodes evaluated:
depth 2: 10647

Time complexity:
b = branching factor
d = depth

O(b^d)

Space complexity:
since there is a node to represent each possible state in the tree, space complexity is the same as time complexity.

Alpha-Beta Algorithm
nodes evaluated:
depth 4: 300
depth 5: 544

Time complexity:
b = branching factor
d = depth

O(b^(d/2))

Space complexity:
since there is a node to represent each possible state in the tree, space complexity is the same as time complexity.
